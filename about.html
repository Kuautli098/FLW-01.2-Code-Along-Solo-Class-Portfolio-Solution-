      About Me

    <!-- task 3: write a short bio about yourself.-->
    <p>
      Some things to know about me: I like to do the things you don't. I'm very much a adrenaline seeker and often spend time skating. I'm currently looking into buying a pair of roller skates becaue they seem like a more convinient way of transportation as oposed to a big bulky skateboard that I have to carry over rough terrain. Music is also one of my favorite intrests and I'm currently in love with Cities Aviv's Black Pleasure 2012 Album.
